# WebDevelopmentDaily
Just a repo to track my daily web development coding.<br>
Similar to #30daysofcodechallenge or #100daysofcodechallenge<br><br>

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JS<br>
Can I dedicate myself to coding daily for at least 100 days or until I master frontend development?<br>
This is the real question.<br>
